ignore the venv for now (doesnt work for some reason, I haven't figureds out yet)

I'm assuming you're doing this in vscode.

you have to install the required modules firsed becasue, see line 1

paste this in the command line:
>`pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy`

*(flask is for running the webpage and sql alchemy is for the database we'll use later on)*

---
## (optional in case of error)

if you get an error kinda like:
>`WARNING: Retrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000017F861B9B50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] 
A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')': /simple/flask/`

with this at the end

>`ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement flask (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for flask`


you can just use this command instead:
>`pip --trusted-host=pypi.python.org --trusted-host=pypi.org --trusted-host=files.pythonhosted.org install flask flask-sqlalchemy`

*(flask is for running the webpage and sql alchemy is for the database we'll use later on)*

---

make sure you're in the directory:
>`app_prototype`

then run in the commandline:
>`python3 app.py`

and the server should be running!

## (optional in case of another error)

if you get an error after trying to run it whilst having installed flask like:
>`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`

then it's most likely a path error (astleast according to the sourcess I used)

which you can edit by using this tutorial cause I can't be fucked rn
