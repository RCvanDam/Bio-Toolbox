# DISCLAIMER: doesn't work

currently I can't say this works on any environment other than my home pc.
it could just be my laptop but I can't get the venv to work(?)
and I am having somne issues with importing flask and pip. 

what I have tried is activating the venv 
(if you wanna try that check out notworking_instructions.md)
the problem I had here was vscode not recognizing the python installation within the venv as a viable interpreter.

and trying to substitute it by globally installing the modules 
(if you wanna try this check out temp_notworking_instructitons.md)

the problem I had was having vscode properly recognise the venv interpreter as a valid python interpreter.

and in the commandline my problem was that it couldn't find the modules in the venv.
(for this I have also tried altering my system and user PATH variable)

here are some sources I used:
