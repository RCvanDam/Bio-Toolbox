**Goal of the project**



 ## **Purpose of our website and tool** 

**The purpose of our tool is that People that have a biology background but not a programming background can use our tool
we are using memesuite and fimo to accomplish this.**

memesuit will be used to find motifs in a DNA,RNA or protein sequence.
A motif is a pattern of nucleotides that fall in a certain position of the sequence, 

in our case its for finding transcriptionpatterns.
or the chance that a certain nucleotide is set in a certain position of the sequence
the use of memesuit is recognising these patterns which can be done by using multifasta. 

fimo works by giving a file with a list of known motifs and the sequence to test if the motifs are in that sequence. 
in our case we are gonna use promoter sequences to find the transcriptionfactorbindingsites fitting to those promoters.
